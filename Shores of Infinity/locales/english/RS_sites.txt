SITE_NAR_ANCIENT_RUINS: <<|
	Far from civilization, ruins from a forgotten era lie silent, only testimony of their builders long gone.
>>

SITE_NAR_RESEARCH_CENTER: <<|
	Somewhere in the vast expanse of what used to be a bustling metropolis, your exploration team discovers an ancient research center. Among collapsed rooms and gutted machinery, remains of beings alien to you lie in awkward stances. Clearly, something wrong happened here. Something very wrong.

	Though badly damaged, some of the databanks are still online.

SITE_RESEARCH_CENTER_RECOVER_FAIL: <<|
	The alien network protocols turned out to be completely incompatible with ours. The connection attempts generated strong electrostatic feedbacks that fried the circuitry of the databanks and shut them down for good.
>>

SITE_NAR_UNIVERSITY: <<|
	Among the ruins of an alien city, your exploration team locates the remains of a university campus. Most of the buildings are nothing more than rubble, but a few of them refuse to collapse.

SITE_NAR_TEMPLE_REMAINS: <<|
  Your exploration team discovers a patchwork of ruined walls, dismembered statues and eroded headstones sitting in the middle of nowhere. From the looks of it, this most likely used to be a religious site for a primitive pre-space civilization.

SITE_NAR_GRANARY: <<|
  A gigantic building in poor but functional condition was located in an isolated region of the planet. Exploration reveals that it is a technologically very advanced granary designed to keep huge grain reserves safe in suspended animation. For an unknown reason, those were never used but they have been perfectly preserved. However, further analysis determined that the conservation system has recently failed ; this means that they will soon be lost if left alone.
>>
SITE_GRANARY_USE: <<|
  Those grain reserves can be planted and provide a permanent source of food for the planet.

>>
SITE_GRANARY_RECOVER: <<|
  The grain can probably be stored in space and exported on a more suitable world. Safely transporting a cargo amount of this magnitude will be difficult and may damage it, though.

  [right][b][color=#e072c9]May gain one Harvest influence card.[/color][/b][/right]
>>
SITE_GRANARY_RECOVER_FAIL: <<|
  Despite taking all necessary precautions, a significant portion of the transport convoy was not able to keep the grain in useable condition. Unfortunately, the remaining reserves are not sufficient to durably sustain an entire population.
>>

SITE_NAR_ODDITY: <<|
	An unusual planetary feature stands out in this region. What secrets does it hide?
>>

SITE_NAR_CRYSTALLINE_FORMATION: <<|
	In the middle of a large open area, a tall crystalline formation stands up like a shimmering, twisted tower coveting the sky. Its many faces reflecting ambient light seem to slightly vary in color over time. Some members of your exploration team swear they even move imperceptibly. Sensors indicate that some sort of slowly pulsating vibration emanates from the base of the formation, many times larger.
>>
SITE_CRYSTALLINE_FORMATION_DRAW: <<|
	Applying conductive materials to the base transmits a strong electric current. Completely covering it with a conductive layer will allow us to use the site as a potent source of energy.

	[right][b][color=#42b4bd]+$1 Energy generation.[/color][/b][/right]
>>
SITE_CRYSTALLINE_FORMATION_ENERGIZE: <<|
	One of your scientists believes that directing a powerful energy burst towards the base may trigger a self-sufficient chain reaction, essentially transforming the structure into an extremely powerful reactor.

	[right][b][color=#42b4bd]+$1 Energy generation.[/color] [color=#ff0000]May be dangerous.[/color][/b][/right]
>>
SITE_CRYSTALLINE_FORMATION_ENERGIZE_FAIL: <<|
	Unfortunately, the triggered reaction went completely out of control and made the structure into a bomb whose explosion vaporized everything across a large distance, including the crystalline formation itself and your unfortunate team.
>>

SITE_NAR_DARK_CRYSTAL: <<|
	Hidden in a cavern, your explorer team found a huge crystal emerging from the rock. They have no clue as to how it ended up here, and it seemingly cannot be moved. Sensors are going nuts in its vicinity and your team reports feeling uneasy around it.
>>
SITE_DARK_CRYSTAL_WITHDRAW: <<|
	It may be dangerous to stay here. Withdraw your team and leave the crystal alone.
>>
SITE_DARK_CRYSTAL_STUDY: <<|
	Stay and study the crystal. Its might hide incredible secrets.

	[right][b][color=#ff0000]May be dangerous.[/color][/b][/right]
>>
SITE_DARK_CRYSTAL_STUDY_SUCCESS: <<|
	After a long time, your team reports that it is possible to attune one to the crystal and draw its power, some kind of aura that seemingly bends other's will to one's own.

SITE_DARK_CRYSTAL_STUDY_FAIL: <<|
	Something went wrong. The last report received from your team is a short holovid recording showing figures, that may or may not be your team members, pounce on one another. Strange, eerie screams can be heard during the whole record.
>>

SITE_NAR_CONTAMINATED_CAVERN: <<|
	While exploring a deep underground cavern, your explorer team discovered the remains of a previous team gone missing. Once brought back to civilization for examination, it quickly became clear that they were somehow infected by a parasitic microorganism. Despite the drastic quarantine measures immediately applied, it is now too late: it is spreading at an alarming rate and already contaminated most of the planet.
>>
SITE_CONTAMINATED_CAVERN_GROWTH: <<|
	Further analysis of the microorganism reveals that it is a parasitic nanomachine blending in organic life forms and mechanical entities alike. While it is damaging to cortex tissues and IA neural networks in the long term, it greatly enhances self-replication and production abilities.

	This microorganism statically charges everything on the planet. While the charges are not high enough to disturb electronics, the amount of energy produced on a global scale could be harnessed with the right equipment.

SITE_NAR_GOLD_VEIN: <<|
	Sensors indicate that a gold vein seems to lie in this area. However, heavy material resonance in the underground layers may induce false readings.

	Dig a hole in the ground and check.

	[right][b][color=#ff0000]Unknown results.[/color][/b][/right]
>>
SITE_GOLD_VEIN_DIG_FAIL: <<|
	The resonance fooled the sensors into a false positive. There is nothing underground but worthless rock.
>>
SITE_GOLD_VEIN_DIG_POOR: <<|
	There is indeed a gold vein here, but it is tiny and will deplete very quickly.
