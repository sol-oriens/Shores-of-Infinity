	The advanced nature of the facility's matter fabricators and the phase shifting it uses to store finished components produce an immense quantity of Research. The technology itself allows the facility to construct anything as if it were a planet, import Labor from other planets, generate 100 Labor per minute and store 5000 Labor. It cannot, however, be used to export Labor to other shipyards.

	The sheer size of the facility makes it impossible to move through conventional means, while its phasing technology causes complications when attempting to use FTL systems to propel it. Additionally, automated security systems of considerable complexity prevent boarding parties from making any progress while attacking it.

	If damaged severely enough, the Guardian Facility will shut down and phase-shift; while its location is no longer a mystery, it will have to be reactivated and repaired again.
